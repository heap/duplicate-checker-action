## Duplicate Checker Action

A Github Action that provides a configurable utility for detecting duplicate text in files after a commit. 

It comes in handy to block hard-to-find bugs with serious adverse impacts that come from duplicating certain content from one file to the next -- for example, merging the same state key for two different terraform contexts. 


## Running Locally
You can modify the make file in the root folder and just run 

```
